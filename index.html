      <h3>About Toby</h3>
      <p>A restaurant industry leader as I worked through college.  I found I enjoyed the everyday challenges as a manager and ended up making a career of it.  I thrived working with large teams and constantly problem solving on the fly. I now have the opportunity as a student with Thinkful, to work towards something I've always been interested in.  I found as a Web Developer these skill should carry over to make me very successful on projects and working with teams</p>
      <p>If I'm not hard at work on the computer or the gym, you may find me challenging myself with some thinking games like chess and poker.</p>
